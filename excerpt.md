Quantum physics describes physical interactions that happen at the atomic and
sub-atomic levels, and underpins the foundation for most of modern technology.
However, physicists are still unsure how to use standard quantum theory to 
answer the following question: what path did a photon take through an 
interferometer before quantum measurement was performed? 

In classical physics, a particle travelling between two points has a single 
trajectory, which can be calculated by specifying its state at either endpoint 
of the trajectory. On the other hand, in quantum physics, the trajectory a 
particle takes between two measurements is a weighted sum, or superposition, of 
every path it could have taken between the two measurements. This gives rise to 
the phenomenon of a particle interfering with itself before being measured, as 
demonstrated by experiments employing the simple Mach-Zehnder interferometer 
and the single-particle version of Young's double slit experiment.
